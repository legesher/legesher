# Language Convention of Legesher

🎉We have the privilege to operate at the intersection of language to provide unhindered creativity, innovation and collaboration. In order to maintain consistency across all translations, here are a couple of things to keep in mind.

## Translations

There is so much beauty found in the language of a person. The words one chooses to express and to explain, are as unique as the person. We could simply translate via Google Translate or similar-tool, but the heart behind this project is to capture the language and culture itself within the translations - to capture the essence of the functionality of the keyword with context and background of the developer's language. It's a lot easier said than done, but this is our heart. ❤️

### Word For Word Translations

If only it were this simple. Sometimes the translations will be as simple as a perfect 1:1 translation. The only thing to keep in mind is to make sure it properly represents the functionality of the keyword, not necessarily the "perfect" translation of an English word.

### Multiple Word / Phrase Translations

This is the sweet spot. Our end goal is to have a key "word" (where _word_ is a loose term), that accurately explains the functionality of the original keyword. If the translation is a collection of words rather than a single word, we'll begin to think about how we can combine the collection into one "collection of characters" (think of the example of `elif`).

### No Clear Translations

> Like what does `lambda` even mean?!

Take yourself back to when you were learning how to program for the very first time. Is there a word (or set of words) that best explains what the teacher/youtube video / online tutorial was trying to capture when explaining what the keyword does?
